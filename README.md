# GeneticAlgorithm-CSC535-

Implementation of a Genetic Algorithm on a board game called Jump It. The given file: input.txt, has digits in a row
formation that represent the board for a single game. There are in total 100 games, or boards, given in that file. This game 
simulates a playerâ€™s possible options to start at the beginning, traverse the board, and reach the end with a minimal cost. 
Players are allowed to move to the adjacent cell, or jump that cell to move to the one directly next to it. The total cost 
represents every landed cell summed value at that given cell. The goal of the genetic algorithm is to produce a population 
that should be able to play the game and determine the least costly path.
